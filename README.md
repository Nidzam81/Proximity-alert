# Proximity-alert

To use the code, put the file into tensorflow research\object\object detection folder.
For this ecample, I'm using my own trained frozen graph created in inference_graph folder.
You can edit the file to use any default pre-trained model that you wanted.
Set the MODEL_NAME to the pre-train model folder for example faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.
Run python filename.
good luck
