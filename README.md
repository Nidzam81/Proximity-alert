# Proximity-alert

To use the code, put the file into `tensorflow research\object\object detection` folder.
For this example, I'm using my own trained frozen graph created in inference_graph folder.
You can edit the file to use any default pre-trained model that you want.
Set the MODEL_NAME to the pre-train model folder, for example `faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28`.
Run `python filename`.
good luck
